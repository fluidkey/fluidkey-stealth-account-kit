The Fluidkey Trust Kit is an open source repository of the core cryptographic functions used by Fluidkeyâ€™s interface and SDK. It enables anyone to independently generate and recover Fluidkey stealth smart accounts and related funds. 

It is composed of the following functions:
- `generateKeysFromSignature`: generates a user's private keypair from a signature
- `extractViewingPrivateKeyNode`: extracts a [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) node from a private viewing key
- `generateEphemeralPrivateKey`: generates an ephemeral private key based on the private viewing key node
- `generateStealthAddresses`: generates stealth addresses based on an ephemeral secret and a list of public spending keys
- `predictStealthSafeAddress`: predicts the address of a stealth safe based on a list of stealth address owners

An example of how to use these functions to recover stealth addresses based on a user's privateKey can be found in the `example` folder.
