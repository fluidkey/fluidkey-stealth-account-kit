The Fluidkey Stealth Account Kit is an open source TypeScript library containing the core cryptographic functions used by [Fluidkey](https://fluidkey.com). It enables anyone to independently generate and recover stealth smart accounts and related funds.  

A written companion explaining the usage of the kit in Fluidkey's processes can be found in the [technical walkthrough](https://docs.fluidkey.com/technical-walkthrough).

We hope to see more developers build privacy-preserving applications with the kit. If you have questions about the kit or want to contribute, reach out at hey@fluidkey.com.

Contents
--------
The library is composed of the following functions:
- [`generateKeysFromSignature`](/src/generateKeysFromSignature.ts): generates a user's private keypair from a signature
- [`extractViewingPrivateKeyNode`](/src/extractViewingPrivateKeyNode.ts): extracts a [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) node from a private viewing key
- [`generateEphemeralPrivateKey`](/src/generateEphemeralPrivateKey.ts): generates an ephemeral private key based on the private viewing key node
- [`generateStealthAddresses`](/src/generateStealthAddresses.ts): generates stealth addresses based on an ephemeral secret and a list of public spending keys
- [`predictStealthSafeAddressWithClient`](/src/predictStealthSafeAddress.ts): predicts the address of a stealth [Safe](https://safe.global/) based on a list of stealth address owners (EOAs) calling the Safe Proxy Factory Deployment contract
- [`predictStealthSafeAddressWithBytecode`](/src/predictStealthSafeAddress.ts): predicts the address of a stealth [Safe](https://safe.global/) based on a list of stealth address owners (EOAs) simulating the CREATE2 call using the bytecode of the to-be deployed Safe Proxy

An example of how to use these functions to recover stealth accounts based on a user's private key can be found in the [`example`](/src/example/example.ts) folder. 

Get Started
-----------
To get started, install the package with your preferred package manager.
  
  ```bash
  npm install @fluidkey/stealth-account-kit
  yarn add @fluidkey/stealth-account-kit
  ```

Start using the library by importing the functions you need. 

```typescript
import { 
  generateKeysFromSignature, 
  extractViewingPrivateKeyNode,
  generateEphemeralPrivateKey,
  generateStealthAddresses,
  predictStealthSafeAddressWithClient,
} from '@fluidkey/stealth-account-kit'
```
